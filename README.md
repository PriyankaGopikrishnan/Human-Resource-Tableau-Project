# Human-Resource-Tableau-Project

### Project Overview

This HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.
